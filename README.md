# Rajasthan_Hackathon_4.0
Created for Rajasthan Hackathon 4.0
BEST VIEWED WITH GOOGLE CHROME 75% ZOOM.

This project demonstration involves the use of 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JSON, BootStrap, Modern Day CSS Grid, Flexbox System and Google Maps and a Live Weather API'.

I have created three files for the project demonstration. The first one is named web2.html. And this is the home page of the website.

The second file is named weather.html. You can see the live version of that project by going on my codepen id                             ( https://codepen.io/sanchit0496/full/ZxLRoG/ ), in case the API doesn't respond well on your computer. 
It gives the present latitude and longitude of the location of the device, as well as several weather conditions like humidity, wind speed, minimum temperature, maximum temperature etc. Using the latitude and longitude, a person can spot his position and save himself from getting lost.

The third file is named info.html. This file contains information about the Chittorgarh Fort. The History of Chittorgarh, The Tourism at Chittorgarh, The Fairs and Festivals, and How to Reach That Place. 
The file will also have a unique maps feature, that will automatically locate the user's location and will then guide him to reach that place. Such informative pages will be created for every tourist places and forts of Rajasthan.

I am also creating a database, that will contain the information of all the Police Stations, Hospitals, ATMs, Post Offices, Hotels and other such helpline numbers like the local fire brigade etc.
After this, the website will be developed in a way that it start displaying the location of all the nearby police stations, hospitals, ATMs etc to the tourist (extracting latitude and longitude from the Google Maps API).
Other than all of this, brief information about Bus Routes, Auto Routes, and Railway Routes will also be displayed to the tourists, so that they don't have to face any difficulty in finding the most suitable correct traveling route for them and their acquantainces.
